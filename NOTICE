    Fork https://github.com/onyxpoint/pupmod-concat into something that more
    closely resembles https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-concat.

    We have done this as we have used concat in multiple locations and wanted
    to avoid a large API change, but also to learn some puppet internals.
    The experience and speed up gained should inspire further native types.
